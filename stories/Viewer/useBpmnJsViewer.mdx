import { SimpleProcess } from "./useBpmnJsViewer.stories";

# Overview

This hook provides a generic utility to integrate any viewer implementation based on the `BaseViewer` from `bpmn-js` into a React environment. As return value the caller receives a callback which can be passed as `ref` property and the `BaseViewer` instance.

# Usage

```tsx
import React from "react";

import { useBpmnJsViewer, BaseViewer, BaseViewerOptions } from "bpmn-react/Viewer";

const BpmnJsViewer = ({ xml }: { xml: string }) => {
    const [handleViewerRef, viewer] = useBpmnJsViewer<BaseViewer, BaseViewerOptions>({
        factory: (options) => new BaseViewer(options),
        options: {} as BaseViewerOptions,
    });

    return <div ref={ handleViewerRef } />
}
```

# Examples

<Story of={ SimpleProcess } />
