import { Story } from "@storybook/blocks";

import { SimpleProcess } from "./useNavigatedViewer.stories";

# Overview

This hook is a specialized form of `useBpmnJsViewer` that uses the `NavigatedViewer` from `bpmn-js`. Similarly, it returns a callback which can be passed as `ref` property and the `NavigatedViewer` instance.

# Usage

```tsx
import React from "react";

import { useNavigatedViewer, BaseViewerOptions } from "bpmn-react/Viewer";

const BpmnJsViewer = ({ xml }: { xml: string }) => {
    const [handleViewerRef, viewer] = useNavigatedViewer({} as BaseViewerOptions);

    return <div ref={ handleViewerRef } />
}
```

# Examples

<Story of={ SimpleProcess } />
